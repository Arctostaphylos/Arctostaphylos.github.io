		<h3>Navigating Conflict</h3>
		<p>I found this topic extremely difficult to write about as I can't think of an emotional conflict I can write about. I find that clear, empathic and honest communication tends to diffuse any tensions before they escalate into a conflict. In researching the root causes of conflict, it seems that conflicts between people have a few basic sources. One source of conflict is conflicting resources, where each person needs a particular resource and is in conflict with someone else for the same resource. Another possibility is conflicting styles, values or perceptions. Each person has their own particular way of working and way of viewing the situation. These kinds of conflicts are most easily diffused by getting the underlying perceptions out in the open so that each person can appreciate the different approach of the other without judgement. The last source of conflict can be conflicting goals, responsibilities or roles. These are roles or responsibilites assigned by other people, and it's possible to receive conflicting information or goals that are mutually exclusive. Again, negotiating with the person who set those goals is the key to diffusing the conflict. </p>

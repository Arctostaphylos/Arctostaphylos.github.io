		<h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
		<p>Test driven development is a method for writing software where the test is written first. The sequence of steps is 1. write the test. The test should initially fail because the feature or behavior to be added doesn't yet exist. If it passes something is wrong with the test or the feature already exists in the code. 2. Write some code. 3. Run the tests again. Once the code is passing the tests the final step is 4. Refactor. Repeat.</p>
		<p>So why do things this way? The first reason is that it makes finding bugs easier because each small unit of code is tested individually, and the tests also pinpoint which part of the code is failing and why. </p>

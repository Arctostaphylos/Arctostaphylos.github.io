		<h3>Functional vs. Object-Oriented programming</h3>
		<p>I've been learning Ruby, which is an object oriented language. In Ruby, everything is
			an object. What that means is that when you're organizing your program, you think about it in terms of objects that have states and behavior and that pass messages between objects to accomplish the goals of the program. For example, you can have a class Car with many different Car objects. The red car might accelerate faster than the blue car, and these attributes are unique to each car object. 
			</p>
			<p>Functional programming is sometimes considered the opposite of object oriented 
				programming. In functional programming, programs are organized around functions. The idea is that functions take parameters and return results, but there aren't objects that maintain information about their state. This is supposed to make functional programs easier to debug, because for a given parameter, the function will always return the same result. This isn't neccessarily true in Ruby, where you can call a method on an object and get a different answer depending on the object you're sending the message to and the object's state at the time. </p>

		<h3>Affirming Values</h3>
		<p>Last week I wrote about stereotype threat, and how afirming personal values can reduce stereotype threat. The key is to see oneself in terms of being more than just part of a particular group. By emphasizing shared values with others, you can develop identities beyond that of gender or race. This can be effective in a workplace situation where the shared values of the team can help overcome anxiety about personal identity as part of a group under stereotype threat.</p>
		<p>For myself, reviewing the core values I identified at the start of phase 0, community, competance and connection, help me to remember that I'm not alone in this process of learning to code and feeling challenged by the material. </p>

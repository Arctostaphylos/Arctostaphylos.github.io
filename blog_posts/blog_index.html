		<h3>Feedback</h3>
		<p>From the beginning of phase 0, I have heard about the importance of feedback to the Dev Bootcamp experience. 
		Feedback is an important part of learning, because without feedback we don't know how our actions are affecting 
		others and don't have the information we need to change behavior. Feedback doesn't have to be negative, it can be
		just as helpful to hear where you're doing well. But negative feedback is often challenging. The challenge with negative feedback is twofold, giving it in a way that can be heard, and hearing it without becoming defense or dismissive.</p>
		<p>The emphasis in Dev Bootcamp is giving feedback that is specific, actionable and kind. Specific feedback is easier
		to hear because it's about a concrete experience, and is less likely to be judgemental. The difference between "you're 
		too quiet" vs. "I noticed you didn't say anything in the meeting" is that the second is a specific observation that
		isn't open to debate as opposed to a judgement about that person's behavior. Actionable means it's something that the
		person can act on to do better next time if they choose to. Kind feedback is not judgemental. It is providing an honest
		assessment of the person's behavior and the consequences of that behavior without judging that behavior or person as good or bad. The goal is to up a mirror for the person to see themselves. By not being judgmental, the person recieving the feedback is more likely to hear it.</p>
		<p>So why can it be so hard to hear and take in feedback? One piece is that negative feedback is likely to trigger an emotional response of shame. Shame is an uncomfortable emotion, and the temptation is to dismiss or disregard feedback, or act defensively and attack the person giving the feedback rather than acknowleging the validity of the feedback. The challenge of receiving feedback is to recognize one's own typical emotional response, and separate that emotional trigger from the content of the feedback. This requires being mindful of one's own emotional state. Reflecting back what you heard to the person giving the feedback can also help you listen rather than just react to the feedback. Of course, just because you recieve feedback from someone doesn't automatically mean that feedback is accurate or useful. It's important to evaluate the feedback: is it useful? Do you hear the same thing from multiple sources? This is why specific feedback is so much more valuable, because it is easier to assess and ultimately assimilate.</p>

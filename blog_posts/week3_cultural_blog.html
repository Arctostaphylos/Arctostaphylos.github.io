		<h3>Pairing and Feedback</h3>
		<p>So far my experience pairing has been very positive. I'm finding it very helpful to have another set of eyes to catch syntax errors, and to bounce ideas off of. Pairing has really increased my understanding of javascript.  Having to explain my ideas made the concepts I have been reading about more tangible, and it was incredibly useful to try and explain why I thought we should proceed one way rather than another. Pairing also provides motivation to stay focused and really do my best.</p>
		<p>The feedback I've received so far confirmed my own experience, that I tend to want to have control over the interaction. Even when I'm driving I can be a bit of a back-seat navigator, and this confirms my experience of mild frustration when my partner doesn't get a particular topic or understand the logic of how I want to proceed. I need to be sure I'm listening to my partner and not getting too invested in my own ideas of how the project should proceed. I think it's important to me to really stick to the specific roles of driver or navigator in a pairing session.</p>
		<p>Writing feedback for others has been very straightforward for me. I'm used to giving feedback on my student's performance, so thinking about specific and actionable feedback is somewhat second nature for me. Overall I appreciate the structures in place to give formal feedback at DBC.</p>

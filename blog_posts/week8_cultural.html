		<h3>DBC culture</h3>
		<p>The topic for this week is about the DBC culture and how we, as future participants, respond to that culture. I'm a teacher, and have been teaching for over 20 years in different environments, so I've thought a lot about how people learn and how to teach. Unfortunately, the most effective way to learn is not the easiest way to teach. There's a lot of research out there that confirms that experiential learning is the most effective way to master new material, but it's pretty much antithetical to the lecture and test based culture of most classrooms. When I've tried to incorporate a more experiential approach, I've gotten a lot of push back from students who were uncomfortable with directing their own learning.</p>
		<p>So I'm really excited by what I see at DBC. Firstly, I appreciate the focus on emotional intelligence and empathy. Secondly, I really like the emphasis on taking ownership of your own learning. Even from the beginning of the prep work where we were encouraged to find our own answers and solutions rather than simply following the steps laid out for us, it's clear that this is a situation that requires active participation not passive inculcation. I'm excited to see what we can create as a community.</p>

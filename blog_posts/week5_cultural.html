		<h3>Women in Tech</h3>
		<p>The New York Times had an excellent article recently discussing the issue of women in technology fields called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0">Technology's Man Problem</a>. The article discusses how women in tech fields feel alienated by the male dominated culture. Not only do women make up a small proportion of tech jobs to begin with, but they leave science, engineering and technology jobs at a much higher rate than men do, often to pursue something else. This suggests that the attention put on encouraging women to pursue STEM (science, technology and math) careers in education is not enough, there have to be changes to the culture in these fields to retain women. The article pointed out that startups are particularly prone to problems of unchecked sexism because there is often a lack of HR bureaucracy that in larger companies provides workers an avenue to address issues of intimidation or harrasment. In the end, change to tech culture will depend on people speaking out against mistreatment of women in the workplace, and the willingness of those who are in a position to effect change to listen.</p>

		<h3>Database Query Optimization</h3>
		<p>There's a lot of information about how to speed up or optimize database queries using SQL. Some of the optimization techniques depend on good database design, but many depend on using SQL wisely. Here are some of the suggestions I found for writing good queries.</p>
		<p>First of all, only ask for what you really need. Rather than writing SELECT *, select specific columns. It also speeds searches if you can avoid using wildcards. If you must use wildcards, it can be faster to search with a postfix wildcard such as "name%" than a full or prefix wildcard. If you need to determine whether a particular column contains data, it's faster to use EXIST rather than COUNT(). It's also better to avoid the NOT operator if possible. </p>
		<p>Another technique for speeding up data queries is to create an index for fields that are commonly searched. The disadvantage of creating indexes is that can slow data insertion and table updating, but used carefully, they can be beneficial. </p>
		<p>Minimizing joins also speeds up searches. If you have to include joins, it's better to join on fields that are indexed. It's also better to minimize the number of subqueries in a query.</p>

		<h3>What is Rails?</h3>
		<p>So what is Rails anyway? Rails is a web application development framework written in Ruby, that is useful for quickly building complex websites. In other words, Rails is a Ruby Gem that provides a framework for the development of websites. One aspect of Rails is a "convention over configuration" perspective that means that Rails has a default configuration rather than requiring the developer to configure everything from scratch. While these defaults can be overridden, the defaults keep initial development simple.  </p>

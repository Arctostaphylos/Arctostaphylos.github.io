		<h3>Why Javascript?</h3>
		<p>The question is why is JavaScript so popular in web development? In reading various articles on the internet, I found a lot of different opinions about how JavaScript became the dominant language used for client side programming, but the fact is pretty much every major website, like Google and Facebook, uses Javascript for the client side.</p>
		<p> First of all, it's useful to understand the difference between client side and server side. Client side means that the action is taking place on the client's computer. In other words, the web browser on your computer is doing the actual work of creating your webpage. An example would be google maps. Rather than send a message to the server and wait for information to come back every time you want to scroll around the map, the map is updated on the client side by your browser running a JavaScript program. Server side means the program is running on a web server somewhere, and sending the results to your browser. Ruby is an example of a server side language that can interact with databases stored on a central computer or server like the database used by your bank to keep track of everyone's balance. Server-side programs are needed to interact with that database and pass your browser the information you request about your balance.</p>
		<p>JavaScript's power is that it is a language universally understood by any web browser. That means anyone can run JavaScript on their computer, and no matter which browser they use, it can run a JavaScript program. </p>

		<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
		<p>Stereotype threat refers to the diminished performance in a situation that
			would confirm a negative stereotype about one's group. For example, women
			given the same standardized math test did worse when their gender was 
			emphasized, and they were made more aware of the gender stereotype that 
			women don't do as well as men in math. Their performance was undermined by
			the concern that they would confirm this negative stereotype about women.
		</p>
		<p>The factors involved in stereotype threat involve undermining the efficiency of working memory, including increased anxiety and negative thoughts
			which can act to reduce working memory capacity, as well as lowered performance
			expectations. For example, when under stereotype threat, the activity can
			seem overwhelming given self perception of abilities. Lower performance expectations
			can also lead to reduced effort. The anxiety of battling the negative stereotypes
			about one's group reduces the attention one has for the task at hand, and can
			decrease performance. </p>

			<p>Most of the research on stereotype threat has been in an academic context, examining
			the effect of stereotype threat on women in math, or minorities in college. One aspect
			of stereotype threat that is particularly disabling is that people who most value
			high performance are at greater risk of stereotype threat. Some of the research has
			focused on mechanisms to aleviate stereotype threat. Allowing people to afirm their
			self worth by encouraging them to think about skills or values that they think are
			important is one mechanism. Another is to provide an external attribution for the
			anxiety or difficulty they experience. For example, telling students that the anxiety
			they feel is due to an external cause, such as stereotype threat, improves performance 
			on tests.</p>
			<p>Translating these research findings to a workplace context is less well studied, but
				is an important question for fields where women and minorities are under-represented
				like the tech industry. Application of the research to the workplace suggests that
				explicitly addressing negative stereotypes is helpful, as is reducing the power of
				negative stereotypes by focusing on the indentities that transcend race of gender, such as shared values or goals. Role models from under represented groups can also
				help.

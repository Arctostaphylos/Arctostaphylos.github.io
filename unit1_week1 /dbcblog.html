	<p>One of my favorite, or at least frequently visited websites is the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>. This site is one of my go-to sites when I have to kill some time. I can nearly always find something interesting to read.</p>
	<p>The layout of the site reflects the layout of the physical paper, with a clear banner and very clean, stark design. Anything with color, such as a picture or video really stands out against the otherwise monochrome black and white of the rest of the design. The design of the site matches the content well and gives an air of being serious and authoratative.</p>
	<p>Navigating the site is very well laid out. The home page is laid out in clear sections with top stories and editorials in separate columns. Further down the page the top stories from each section of the paper are highlighted. From each story it is easy to find more stories in that section or to move to other sections of the paper using the navigation at the top of the page. The site is also very good at making suggestions about what the user might find interesting based on past browsing history.</p><br>

	<p>Another site that I've used in the past, both to buy and sell items is <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>. It's a site designed to allow craftspeople to sell their items directly to buyers. When I was regularly making art this was one of my primary marketing websites, and it was very cost effective and both easy and fun to use.</p>
	<p>The home page changes every time you visit it, to highlight different artists or products. The home page also captures the intent of the site well, that purchasing directly from artisans is a way of supporting non-corporate culture. It does this by dominating the design with images of people actually making things, and so it emphasizes the handmade quality of items purchased from the site. Visually the site is clean, but eclectic and a little quirky. This fits well with the nature of the content.</p>
	<p>Navigation through the site is fairly straightforward. The home page provides links at the top to different categories of items, as well as highlighting different aspects of the site, such as the top picks of other Etsy members, or information as to how the site operates. Diving into the site, navigation remains simple due to clear navigation options at both the top and bottom of the pages. The bottom navigation in particular can lead you to related items which is a useful and fun way to explore the site.</p><br>
	<p>The third site that I visit often is <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/blog/not-exactly-rocket-science/">Not Exactly Rocket Science</a> which is a general science blog that mostly follows biology. It's hosted by National Geographic, and it's one of several science blogs associated with the National Geographic website.</p>
	<p>The overall look of the page is dominated by the header that has navigation to the rest of the National Geographic site. Within the blog, the overall look is blocky. Each blog post has a photo, title, and the beginnings of the first sentence. To actually read the post you have to click through to another page which I find irritating.  It takes a lot of scrolling down to look over the recent posts. Once you're at the page for a particular post, it's not hard to find navigation to other articles at the bottom of the page. </p>
	<p>Even though I like the articles in this blog and find them interesting, I don't visit the page as often as I might because I find the overall design irritating and visually disorganized. There's a lot of different fonts used over the page and the navigation is dominated by large black blocks (to be consistent with the NatGeo theme) that I find visually distracting.</p>

	<p>The first site I analyzed is the New York Times. The website is trying to recreate the feel of the physical paper. Visually the site has a lot of content that needs to be easy to scan. The navigation emphasizes breaking news stories at the top of the page, and easy access to different sections towards the bottom of the page.<img src="http://s25.postimg.org/c6jr2x4rz/img018.jpg"</p>
	<p>The second site I visited was the blog <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/blog/not-exactly-rocket-science/">Not Exactly Rocket Science</a> hosted on the National Geographic website. The main problem for this page is presenting the blog posts in an orderly and easy to access manner, while providing enough information about each post to convince the reader to actually read the story. Visually the site is dominated by the images associated with each blog entry. The overall structure of the page meets these goals, but I think there's generally not enough information from each blog post to tell the reader if the post is worth reading in full. <img src="http://s25.postimg.org/vluiw0y27/img017.jpg"></p>
	<p>The final page is a page from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/?ref=si_home">Etsy</a>, specifically one of the pages showing an item for sale. The problem the page is solving is to showcase the particular item, while also showing the range of items available from that seller. Visually, the item for sale needs to be the dominant focus, and the rest of the page needs to compliment and not distract from that focus. The site is very clean and uncluttered.

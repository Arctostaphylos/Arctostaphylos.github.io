	<p><strong>Exercise 1:</strong> Values that are important to me are Community, Competence, Connection. It's just a fluke that they all begin with the letter C.</p>
	<p><strong>Exercise 2:</strong> Connection is important to me, and so I added to the list. It's an integral part of what makes a community function, and it's at the heart of what people are searching for with each other. Often this gets thought of in terms of romantic attachment and love, but heart-felt connection can happen between people regardless of romantic attachment. For me, connection with other people is what makes life joyful and worth living.</p>
	<p><strong>Exercise 3: </strong>I very much agree that I try to live up to these values.</p>
	<p><strong>Exercise 4:</strong> The last topic that someone asked my advice about was the process of making a woodblock print.</p>
